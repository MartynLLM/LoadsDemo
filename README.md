# Loads Demo
This repository contains Python code for assessing the performance of loads statistics by simulating streamflow and chemistry time series with arbitrary correlations and variance relationships.

Currently, loads.py takes a .json file, cq_generator_parameters.json, which lists .csv files containing input flow andchemistry data, statistics for simulation and the name of output SQLite database. 

A test data set is available in the sampleData folder
