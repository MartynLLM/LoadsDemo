# Loads Demo
This repository contains Python code for assessing the performance of loads statistics by simulating streamflow and chemistry time series with arbitrary correlations and variance relationships.

Currently, minimal_generator_json.py takes a .json file, generator_parameters.json, which lists a .csv file containing input data, statistics for simulation and an output SQLite database. 

The code has been tested with flow time series and will be refined to also include chemical data.
